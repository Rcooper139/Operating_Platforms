# Operating_Platforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
o	The client was a video game company who wanted to develop a web-based gaming application that can be used across all the different gaming platforms. The game would be called “Draw It or Lose It”.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
o	I thought that I did well in the recommendation section. I liked this section the most because everything that we learned throughout the course came full circle and I was able to elaborate on everything. It was also the part where I felt like I retained the most important parts from this course. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
o	The main thing that helps with developing the code is completing the flow chart so we can see what classes and methods need to be created. Then it makes it easier because we have the “map” to guide us on what else needs to be completed. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
o	I would revise the executive summary to make it more concise and I would also fix the design constraints so that it exactly matches the limitations given by the client. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
o	The software should always start with getting input from what the users wish to have or what capabilities they would like to be able to do. After discussing their vision, it is much easier to go about designing a draft and making smaller modifications as best see fit by the end-user.
